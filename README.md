# Coupling Deep Learning and Google Earth Engine for Global Daily River Dissolved Oxygen Reconstruction

This project presents a transformer-based deep learning framework to reconstruct daily dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers at a global scale by integrating hydrometeorological datasets and watershed attributes. The study addresses the challenges of spatiotemporal gaps in water quality records and provides new insights into the key drivers of DO dynamics worldwide.

## Highlights

- Developed a global-scale transformer model for daily river dissolved oxygen reconstruction.
- Integrated hydrometeorological data and basin characteristics for robust predictions.
- Achieved a Nashâ€“Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.72 over 403 global river stations.
- Identified 30-day cumulative air temperature as the primary driver of DO dynamics.

## Main Features

- Handling sparse water quality data and large data gaps.
- All input variables are derived from datasets with global coverage.
- Model interpretability for input importance.
